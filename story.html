          Story of Gorillaz' universe is truly gigantic and consists of 7 phases
          with 8th one coming soon alongside with a new album "The Cult". But
          for the minimal understanding it's very important to divide the all
          phases from the biography and backgrounds of all four characters? to
          know where and how their roads crossed. <br />

        <p>
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’™</span><mark class="two_d_mark">Stuart Pot</mark> was born on
          23 May 1978 to David and Rachel Pot. The original surname of Stuart's
          father was "Tusspot", but he legally changed it to "Pot", shortly
          before Stuart was born.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’™</span>His father, David, works as a mechanic and as a
          fairgrounds worker, while his mother, Rachel, works as a nurse. He was
          born in Hertfordshire, England and grew up there until he and his
          family had to move to Crawley, West Sussex, England where he attended
          St Wilfrid's Catholic School after he broke his piano teacher's hand
          and caused a lawsuit. When he was 11 years old, Stuart was involved in
          an accident where he fell from a tree and hit his head. This caused
          all his natural brown hair to shed, until it eventually grew back in a
          <mark class="two_d_mark">deep azure blue color</mark>. The accident
          also caused him to experience frequent migraines, for which his mother
          supplied him with painkillers.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’™</span><mark class="two_d_mark">At age 19,</mark> Stuart was
          hit in the face by Murdoc Niccals when he crashed his Vauxhall Astra
          into Uncle Norm's Organ Emporium in an attempt to raid the store of
          its musical equipment. This caused Stuart to receive hyphema in his
          left eye and put him into a coma. Murdoc was then arrested and
          sentenced to 30,000 hours of community service, as well as to care for
          the vegetablized Stuart for ten hours a week.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’™</span>Not long after, Murdoc injured Stuart again while
          pulling off 360 donuts to impress a small crowd of women. Stuart came
          crashing through the windshield of the car and fractured his other
          eye. After the incident, he woke up from his vegetative state and was
          given the <mark class="two_d_mark">nickname "2-D"</mark>, which refers
          to the two dents in his head. He was then recruited by Murdoc and
          chosen to be the lead vocalist of a new band he was forming after his
          last band had broken up. Gorillaz call the day 2-D and Murdoc first
          crossed paths "D-Day".

          ><mark class="murdoc_mark">Murdoc Alphonse Niccals</mark> was born in
          Stoke-On-Trent on June 6th, 1966. Although the exact whereabouts were
          never verified, it was rumored that his mother gave birth to him at
          the Belphegor Sanatorium, a halfway house for "the sick, the needy,
          and the incredibly bored."<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’š</span>As an infant, he was
          <mark class="murdoc_mark">dumped on the doorstep</mark> of his
          father's house one night and was discovered by him as he was returning
          home from the pub.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’š</span>Murdoc went on to a very
          <mark class="murdoc_mark">abusive childhood</mark>. It has been
          proposed that his many addictions and his sour attitude were due to
          his abusive childhood. His father, Sebastian Jacob Niccals, (or Jacob
          Sebastian Niccals, depending on who's asking) was a spiteful drunk of
          a man who often verbally abused and exploited his sons.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’š</span>At some point in the early 1990s, Murdoc founded
          <mark class="murdoc_mark"
            >a band called, Murdoc's Burning Sensations</mark
          >. Not much is known about the band outside of being a featured
          headliner for a concert at the Withered Hand in Stoke-on-Trent on
          November 29, 1994. It is assumed that the band broke up at some point
          prior to 1997 due to unknown circumstances.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’š</span>One day while skidding his car around a car park in
          Nottingham, Murdoc
          <mark class="murdoc_mark"
            >accidentally sent Stuart flying through the windshield into a
            curb</mark
          >, giving Stuart a fracture on his right eye, yet waking him up from
          his coma. Impressed by Stuart's appearance, describing him as "a
          blue-haired, black-eyed god", Murdoc recruited him as the lead singer
          and keyboardist for his band and gave him the nickname 2-D for the two
          dents in his head.

          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’—</span><mark class="noodle_mark">Noodle</mark> was born in
          Osaka, Kansai, Japan on October 31, 1990. She spent a portion of her
          childhood in Japan as a subject of a classified Japanese super soldier
          project under the management of the Japanese scientist, Mr. Kyuzo.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’—</span>Noodle and twenty-two other children were trained for
          the sole purpose of fighting as soldiers for the
          <mark class="noodle_mark">Japanese military</mark> and government.
          After the children were deemed too dangerous and unstable for combat,
          the project was scrapped. Mr. Kyuzo was then ordered to dispose of all
          possible traces of the failed experiment, as well as its participants.
          Kyuzo killed the twenty-two child soldiers, but was still reluctant to
          kill Noodle. Deciding to spare her, Kyuzo placed her in a state of
          amnesia through the use of verbal commands. The phrase used to place
          Noodle in her state of amnesia was "Ocean Bacon." After temporarily
          <mark class="noodle_mark">clearing her memory</mark> of the project,
          Kyuzo smuggled Noodle to the United Kingdom in a FedEx crate and
          falsely reported her death to his superiors.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’—</span>Noodle arrived at the doorstep of
          <mark class="noodle_mark">Kong Studios in 1998, in a FedEx crate</mark
          >. Once the crate was taken inside, Noodle sprung out of the box and
          performed a guitar solo (which 2-D described as being "brilliant" as
          well as sounding like "200 demons screaming in Arabic"). She ended her
          solo with a twenty-foot high karate kick and saying a few words in
          Japanese before bowing and saying the word "noodle." This earned her
          the name "Noodle" (her only currently known name) and a spot in the
          band as <mark class="noodle_mark">lead guitarist</mark> (replacing
          Paula Cracker).

        <a id="russel"><h5 class="name_of_memb">Russel</h5></a>
        <p>
          <span>ðŸ’›</span><mark class="russel_mark">Russel</mark> was born in
          Brooklyn, New York on June 3, 1975. Known for his good manners and
          eloquent speech, he attended the Xavier School For Young Achievers but
          was expelled after attacking several students while possessed by a
          demon. He fell into a coma for the next four years, at the end of
          which, the demon was finally exorcised from his body by a priest named
          Father Merrin. Russel didn't believe any of it until he saw a picture
          of the "Russel wuz here!" graffiti written in blood on the school
          walls in his handwriting.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’›</span>After his old school refused to take him back, Russel
          attended Brooklyn High School, where he befriended many of the
          students that were
          <mark class="russel_mark">gifted in hip-hop music</mark>.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’›</span>One rainy night outside a 7-Eleven Store, Russel's
          companions were killed in a drive-by shooting by a gang of "gang
          bangers" driving a black Humvee. They were all wearing red hooded
          tops. One of them was wearing a black hood who Russel identified as
          <mark class="russel_mark">The Grim Reaper</mark>. After the shooting,
          the spirits of Russel's friends came to reside in his body, the most
          prominent being Russel's best friend Del the Ghost Rapper. The process
          of possession permanently turned Russel's eyes milky white.<br />
          <br />
          <span>ðŸ’›</span>After the drive-by shooting incident, Russel was sent
          to the UK for his own safety to live with his uncle in Belsize Park.
          He got a job working behind the counter at Big Rick Black's Record
          Shack in London's Soho area. That's when he first encountered Murdoc
          Niccals. While asking Russel for an obscure 50s record, Murdoc slipped
          a bag over Russel's head and forced him out of the shop. Russel was
          taken back to <mark class="russel_mark">Kong Studios</mark> and was
          impressed with the music that Murdoc was working on, so he chose to
          stay.
